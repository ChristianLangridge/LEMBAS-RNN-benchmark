# LEMBAS-RNN benchmarking project

A benchmarking framework for evaluating a novel biologically-informed RNN architecture against standard regression baseline models to predict target gene expression from transcription factor (TF) expression values in human liver tissue (bulk-RNA-seq)

**Rotational project in Roger Williams Institute for Liver Studies at King's College London with Dr. Cheng Zhang**
